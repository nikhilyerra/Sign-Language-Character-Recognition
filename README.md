# Sign-Language-Character-Recognition
My project is an effort towards studying the challenges in classification of characters in American Sign Language(ISL).It aims at extending a step forward in this field by using the data set of the deaf, and then use various feature extraction techniques to extract useful information which is then input into various supervised learning techniques.
